According to Sanford, over 60% of registered Twitter accounts come from outside the US. The growth in accounts internationally isn't surprising, considering that we've seen Twitter's worldwide unique visits rise as U.S. traffic plateaus.\r\n\r\nTwitter also said that following the availability of its site in Spanish in November, the site saw a 50 percent boost in sign-ups from Spanish speaking countries. It seems that current events and political engagement seem to also precipitate growth for Twitter. Following the earthquake in Chile, signups spiked 1200% and nearly all of those were using Spanish as their language. In Colombia, signups are up 300% after politicians started using the network as a platform to speak to constituents.","title":"Twitter: 60 Percent Of Registered Accounts Are From Outside The U.S.","thumb_big_url":"http://cascaad-images.s3.amazonaws.com/10408_457d1a4da47b33e0668986c2622d33e4d5a242e1_bigger.jpeg","thumb_small_url":"http://cascaad-images.s3.amazonaws.com/10408_457d1a4da47b33e0668986c2622d33e4d5a242e1_small.jpeg"},"in_text_url":"http://tcrn.ch/dygBTp","type":"undefined","expanded_in_text_url":"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/08/twitter-60-percent-of-registered-accounts-are-from-outside-the-u-s/"}],"entities":[{"summary":"Twitter is a free social networking and micro-blogging service that enables its users to send and read messages known as tweets. Tweets are text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the author's profile page and delivered to the author's subscribers who are known as followers. Senders can restrict delivery to those in their circle of friends or, by default, allow open access. Users can send and receive tweets via the Twitter website, Short Message Service (SMS) or external applications. While the service itself costs nothing to use, accessing it through SMS may incur phone service provider fees.\nThe 140-character limit on message length was initially set for compatibility with SMS messaging, and has brought to the web the kind of shorthand notation and slang commonly used in SMS messages. The 140 character limit has also spurred the usage of URL shortening services such as tinyurl, bit.ly and tr.im, and content hosting services, such as Twitpic and NotePub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than 140 characters.\nSince its creation in 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Twitter has gained notability and popularity worldwide.

(Benioff cornered one poor CIO with his iPhone demo for a good 20 minutes).  \r\n\r\nI got Benioff to show me the iPhone app on video (after the jump).  It is a supercharged, Chatterized version of Salesforce's iPhone app which is not yet generally available.  But you can see how it is very Facebook-like in that you follow a stream of updates from people you work with.  Each one has a profile.
